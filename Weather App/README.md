# Weather App

## Introduction

You have been taught about loops and arrays. You are going to use that knowledge to build a `Weather App`.
This project has a starter file that contains the HTMl and JS for the task.

# Your Task

Given an array of forecasted temperatures,you are going to display a string with these temperatures.

Example: [17, 21, 23] will print

        17ºC in 1 days
        21ºC in 2 days
        23ºC in 3 days

To get started follow the instructions below

- Create a function `printForecast` which takes in an array 'arr'
- In the `printForecast` function create a variable `str`. Dont assign any value to the variable yet. Make it an empty string
- Transform the array into string by looping through the array. Save the string in the `str` variable you created above. Make sure the string is like the example above.
- Log the string to the console after the loop
- call the `printForecast` function using any of the data array below

## Test Data

- TEST DATA 1: [17, 21, 23]
- TEST DATA 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
